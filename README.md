# Chapter 12 Frameworks

This repo contains three sub projects:

* Ember
* Angular
* Next.JS

It also contains a project called server. All three of the main projects are dependent on server.

## Run the Mock Data Server
```
cd ./server
npm i
npm start
```

Keep this data server running in order for the examples to work properly.
